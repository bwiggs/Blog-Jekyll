To customize the paths and urls of paperclip objects in your rails app you need to modify both the :path and :url options forÂ  has_attached_file in your models. Here's an example...
<code> </code>

<code>
<pre lang="ruby">class SomeModel < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_attached_file :image_one,
    :path => "public/system/:class/:id/:filename",
    :url => "/system/:class/:id/:basename.:extension"

  has_attached_file :image_two,
    :path => "public/system/:class/:id/:filename",
    :url => "/system/:class/:id/:basename.:extension"
end</pre>
</code>
By default Paperclip will store your files in <code>/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename</code>. By passing the <code>:path</code> and <code>:url</code> options to the has_attached_file method in your model you can change where the uploaded files will be stored as well as where they can be accessed. The <code>:path</code> is the directory in your application where your files will be stored. The <code>:url</code> is the url that users will use to render the image.
