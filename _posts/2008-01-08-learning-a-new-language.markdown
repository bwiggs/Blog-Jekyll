Larry O'Brien over at <a title="Knowing.net" href="http://www.knowing.net" target="_blank">knowing.net</a> has a great series called <a title="15 Exercises for Learning a New Programming Language" href="http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-1/" target="_blank">15 Exercises to Know a Programming Language</a>, It's an older article but after going through parts 1-3, theres really nothing in there that changes often enough to warrant any kind of an update.
<ul>
	<li><a title="Part 1" href="http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-1/">Part 1</a> gets you used to using some of the more basic features of a language including, calculations, the standard libraries,  file i/o, GUI development, and debugging.</li>
	<li><a title="Part 2" href="http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-2-data-structures/">Part 2</a> introduces some more advanced data structures, object oriented programming,  idioms, memory issues, design patterns, and concurrency.</li>
	<li><a title="Part 3" href="http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-3-libraries-frameworks-and-mashups/" target="_blank">Part 3</a> presents web interaction, libraries, encryption, and databases.</li>
</ul>
There's obviously a lot to learn when starting to cover a new language. Larry's posted some great ideas for getting used to a new language, and once you accomplish all these, you go from playing with the language to knowing the language.
