Going through an interview can be a rather daunting experience, however this is a good time for a candidate to find out more in depth information about the company, it's culture, processes and many other aspects that may not be immediately realized. This list should serve as a starting ground for job hunters looking to build a dialogue during their interview process.

I would first read through this list and break these up into categories that work for you. Save certain questions for round two or three, or for a more technical person, or for someone in more of a management role. It may be useful to ask some questions only once, or some towards each new intervewer you chat with to get a feel for how each role feels about a certain topic. Also, if you are fortunate to get the name of the person interviewing you, do your research on that person to build up some more topics to talk about during the interview. Finally, do your research on the company as well as demo their products/servces if you can and read through some source code they may have released to the Open Source world (you never know what sort of funny comments you might find that could spark a conversation).
